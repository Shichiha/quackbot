# Explanation of the file bin_was_here
Now, you're probably wondering (or forgot) why  
there is a file called `bin_was_here`.  

It's because bin escaped the sandbox, and made that file himself haha  
	(() => {
	code that escapes sandbox
	})();  

I really should have considered how smart GIO people are before
I made an `>eval` command XD
