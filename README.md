Not a selfbot! 😁

# how to use

git clone this
open terminal and enter `npm i`
add what needs to be added in `src/config.ts` (there is a `src/config.example.ts` it should be intuitive.)
`npm run build:start` (needs typescript for compiling)

# development
development should be pretty intuitive.
Commands are in `src/Commands`, events are in `src/Events`
Handlers for both are in `src/CommandHandler.ts` and `src/EventHandler.ts` respectively.
